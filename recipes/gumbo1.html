    <h2> Description</h2>
    Experience the heart and soul of Southern cuisine with this Authentic Creole Cajun Gumbo, a rich and hearty dish that warms you from the inside out. This gumbo starts with a dark, nutty roux, the cornerstone of its deep flavor, slowly stirred to perfection. Packed with tender pieces of chicken, smoky andouille sausage, and plump shrimp, this gumbo is a savory blend of proteins simmered in a broth bursting with bold Cajun and Creole spices. Okra adds a touch of earthy thickness, while the trinity of onions, bell peppers, and celery bring balance and depth to every spoonful. Served over a bed of fluffy white rice and topped with a sprinkle of fresh green onions, this gumbo is a soul-satisfying dish that captures the essence of Louisiana’s culinary heritage.

        <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>

        <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>

        <li> 1 pound lump crabmeat</li>

        <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
<h2> Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li> Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</li>
    <li> Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped.</li>
    <li> Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.  </li>
    <li> Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.  </li>
    <li> Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo. </li>
    <li> Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving. </li>
    <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
